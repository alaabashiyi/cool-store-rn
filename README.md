<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This application was build using the React Native-CLI (not expo), used redux as a state management, axios for handling api requests. I learned animation to animate the search bar and the scrolling on Flatlist component.
as you scroll down to the bottom of the list it fetches 10 more items and adds it to the list and so on.
when clicking the search bar you can search for items.
